Namaste! This is Pratham Agarwal's github repo for a Pinterest Clone.
This was a Practice Project and was created using MongoDB, ExpressJS, NodeJS and to render the views, I used prebuilt web pages from Codepen which is an opensource library for prebuilt web pages.
I have implemented the following features in this app:
   1. The Sign Up and Login feature: It uses passport.js local strategy for authenticationa and authorization. Here are the pages :
      --> Sign up page:

      --> Login page:

   2. The Profile Page uses multer.js and handles file uploads , also there is a specific area dedicated to show the total number of pins posted by the user.
      On clicking the uploaded pins tab, you will be redirected to a page containing all your uploaded pins. 
      --> Profile Page:

      --> Uploaded pins page:

   3. The next up is the feed page which dynamicallly renders all the posts made by all the users.
      --> Feed Page:

   4. The logout button logs a user out successfully and redirects him to the Sign Up page.
Thank you for paying a visit. I strive to learn and improve so any feedback is duly appreciated.
